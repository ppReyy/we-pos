## ✨ Why TanStack POS?

Running a restaurant is hard enough. Your software shouldn't make it harder.

**TanStack POS** was built by people who understand the chaos of dinner rush—the server who needs to fire an order in seconds, the kitchen staff juggling a dozen tickets, the manager who needs real-time visibility into what's happening on the floor.

This isn't just another POS system. It's a **complete restaurant operations platform** designed for how modern restaurants actually work:

- 🚀 **Blazing fast** — Sub-second order entry, instant kitchen updates
- 📱 **Works everywhere** — Desktop, tablet, or TV displays
- 🔄 **Real-time sync** — WebSocket-powered updates via Socket.IO, everyone sees the same data instantly
- 🎯 **Role-optimized** — Each staff member gets exactly what they need
